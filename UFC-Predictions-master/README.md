### Details

- Scraped event and fight stats, data from 1993 to present date using Beautiful Soup.
- Cleaned, preprocessed and feature engineered the data to each row being a historical representation of both fighters and their individual fights/fight stats.
- Dataset uploaded and now available on Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/rajeevw/ufcdata
- Oversampled minority class, created and tested predictive models using `RandomForestClassifier` and `XGBoostClassifier`
- Created a web app using dash and deployed it with docker on heroku.

### Results

- Accuracy (valid): 0.7218
- AUC Score (valid): 0.7763

![Confusion Matrix](https://github.com/WarrierRajeev/UFC-Predictions/blob/master/conf-matrix.png)

- `0` corresponds to **Blue**: Fighter in the blue corner
- `1` corresponds to **Red**: Fighter in the red corner

- Generally the underdog is in the blue corner and favourite fighter is in the red corner.
- The model is therefore (understandably) having a hard time figuring out when the underdog wins. This is because the sport is very volatile and there can be anything from an injury, psychological loss/trauma to just pure luck that determine the winner.

### Details about the data

#### Context

This is a list of every UFC fight in the history of the organisation. Every row contains information about both fighters, fight details and the winner. The data was scraped from ufcstats website. After fightmetric ceased to exist, this came into picture. I saw that there was a lot of information on the website about every fight and every event and there were no existing ways of capturing all this. I used beautifulsoup to scrape the data and pandas to process it. It was a long and arduous process, please forgive any mistakes. I have provided the raw files incase anybody wants to process it differently. This is my first time creating a dataset, any suggestions and corrections are welcome!

#### Content

Each row is a compilation of both fighter stats. Fighters are represented by 'red' and 'blue' (for red and blue corner). So for instance, red fighter has the complied average stats of all the fights except the current one. The stats include damage done by the red fighter on the opponent and the damage done by the opponent on the fighter (represented by 'opp' in the columns) in all the fights this particular red fighter has had, except this one as it has not occured yet (in the data). Same information exists for blue fighter. The target variable is 'Winner' which is the only column that tells you what happened.
Here are some column definitions:

### How to use from Scratch?

- Clear out the data folder and simply run `scrape_all_data.py` (Note: This will scrape everything from the beginning and hence will take a long time.)
- Run `EDA_and_preprocessing-1.ipynb` and after that `EDA_and_preprocessing-2b.ipynb` (`EDA_and_preprocessing-2a.ipynb` is an alternative where the rows with missing stat values are removed and not treated.)

### Future Possibilities:

- Try weighted moving average instead of simple mean to give more importance to stats of recent fights per fighter

Provided ideas on how to store per fight data. Unfortunately, the entire UFC website and fightmetric website changed so couldn't reuse any of the code.
